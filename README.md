# MMS-Template
Simple Bootstrap Template

After a long time I decided to launch an update with the so-called "Dark Mode" and a user counter connected to your server.

To add the IP to counter you should open "index.html" using a text editor (like NodePad++) and look for `id="online-players"data-server-
ip="play.cubecraft.net" data-server-port="25565" data-update-
time="5000"`and modify the values of:

data-server-ip="play.cubecraft.net" (default)
data-server-port="25565" (default)
data-update-time="5000" (default, in miliseconds)

To the ip and port of your server and an update time that you want

Without more to say, I hope it serves this template :D
